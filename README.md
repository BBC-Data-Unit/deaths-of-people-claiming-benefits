# Deaths of people on benefits prompt inquiry call

In May 2021, the BBC Shared Data Unit [reported](https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-56819727) that cases where people claiming benefits died or came to serious harm had led to more than 150 internal reviews by the Department for Work & Pensions(DWP) since 2012.

Internal reviews were held by the DWP when it was alleged its actions had a negative impact, or when it was named at an inquest.

Calling for an inquiry, Labour MP Debbie Abrahams said: "It needs to be taken out of the hands of the DWP."

The DWP said: "When, sadly, there is a tragic case we take it very seriously."

The internal reviews were not routinely published and bereaved families were not routinely informed when they began.

Separately, the BBC Shared Data Unit [compiled a dataset of press reports](https://drive.google.com/file/d/12or_c9cUspul4IWM1Tiv45tEuWSjyOzf/view?usp=sharing) naming 82 individuals to have died after some alleged DWP activity such as termination of benefits over the same time period as the internal reviews. Mental health vulnerabilities were a contributing factor in 35 of those people's deaths.
