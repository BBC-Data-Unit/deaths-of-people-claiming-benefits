# Scraper

The scraper worked effectively as double-sourcing what had been found separately - that there had been four Prevention of Future Death (PFD) reports sent to the DWP by coroners since 2013. 

For Scotland, we analysed the most recent 100 Sheriffsâ€™ determinations in Fatal Accident Inquiries to check none mentioned the DWP so both were important for the story, even if they weren't mentioned in the text of the BBC report.
